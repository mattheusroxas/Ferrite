## About
A CLI program for YouTube written in Rust.

### Why though
I was inspired by youtube-viewer, and it's many forks, to adapt the idea of a YouTube CLI. Since I use `pipe-viewer` so regularly I thought it would be nice to make my own spin on it and even improve on it in some areas.

## Dependencies
* cargo
* mpv
* youtube-dl

## How to install cargo
### Unix
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
If you're a chad, you'll use your package manager to install `rustup`.
### Windows (If you use Windonk, you need a Winbonk to the head)
Install chocolatey and figure it out, loser

## Installation
```
cargo install
```
