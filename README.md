## About
A CLI program for YouTube written in Rust.

### Why though
I was inspired by youtube-viewer, and it's many forks, to adapt the idea of a YouTube CLI. Since I use `pipe-viewer` so regularly I thought it would be nice to make my own spin on it and even improve on it in some areas.

## Supported platforms
This program will literally run on anything with a terminal; tested on:
* Linux

## Dependencies
* cargo
* mpv
* youtube-dl

### To all you Windonk users out there
Install WSL using the following link. After you've done that just follow all the commands normally.
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

### How to get cargo
First install `rustup`. If you already have a package manager you can use that instead, if not this link should get you sorted: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Now you're all done! If you're a chad you'll install nightly ;)
```
rustup install nightly
```

## Installation
```
cargo install
```
